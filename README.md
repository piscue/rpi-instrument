# Ansible Playbooks for setting a Raspberry Pi as a Musical Instrument

The idea is to transform a Raspbian lite OS to a fully functional OS for being treated as an Instrument, that boots directly to sound by itself.

The base of this code (the handlers and new-default.yml), is obtained from this other [Garth Vander Houwen Github's repo](https://github.com/garthvh/ansible-raspi-playbooks)

This is the initial commit to prepare the repo, this development is not yet in alpha.

The first Musical software intended to run is Puredata
